      <p class="lead">
        From my earliest days, I had this urge to be in the know.
        I would read newspapers and books, and follow business, tech and politics.
        Many things changed but my passion for reading never went away.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I think my biggest asset is my desire to learn new things.
        In my free time, I would seek out tutorials on technical subjects and read articles on different topics.
        Sometimes this desire would lead me to seek breadth over depth.
        I would sometimes be satisfied with my knowledge on a certain subject,
        despite knowing that there's much more to learn.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        But it's also led me to pick up data analysis, machine learning and web development skills
        â€“ all within the last year.
        Over the last year, many things seemed to have connected
        and my learning over the last 20 years seemed to have paid off in a visceral way.

                  I made this visualization of the UCLA Stats program to help students

                  I shared it with more than 700 Stats Club members and got positive feedback.
