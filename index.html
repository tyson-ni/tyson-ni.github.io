      <p class="lead">
        From my earliest days, I had this urge to be in the know.
        I would read newspapers and books, and follow business, tech and politics.
        Many things changed but my passion for reading never went away.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I think my biggest asset is my desire to learn new things.
        In my free time, I would seek out tutorials on technical subjects and read articles on different topics.
        Sometimes this desire would lead me to seek breadth over depth.
        I would sometimes be satisfied with my knowledge on a certain subject,
        despite knowing that there's much more to learn.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        But it's also led me to pick up data analysis, machine learning and web development skills
        â€“ all within the last year.
        Over the last year, many things seemed to have connected
        and my learning over the last 20 years seemed to have paid off in a visceral way.

        I don't want to predict or promise what I might or could do in the future,

        I love side projects. Working on creative ideas born (usually) during showers
        has brought the spontaneous side out of me and stretched my imagination and abilities.

        (For example, this webpage is a continuous project where I apply the latest web dev skills I learned

                  In this machine learning contest, I worked with socio-geographic data and built predictive models.
                  The biggest challenge was to estimate a probability distribution for each observation,
                  rather than simply provide a one-shot classification. To deal with this challenge, I tried random sampling and variable engineering.
                  Having done a few other Kaggle competitions, I learn the most from this.
