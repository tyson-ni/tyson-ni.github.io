      <p class="lead">
        From my earliest days, I had this urge to be in the know.
        I would read newspapers and books, and follow business, tech and politics.
        Many things changed but my passion for reading never went away.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I think my biggest asset is my desire to learn new things.
        In my free time, I would seek out tutorials on technical subjects and read articles on different topics.
        Sometimes this desire would lead me to seek breadth over depth.
        I would sometimes be satisfied with my knowledge on a certain subject,
        despite knowing that there's much more to learn.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        But it's also led me to pick up data analysis, machine learning and web development skills
        â€“ all within the last year.
        Over the last year, many things seemed to have connected
        and my learning over the last 20 years seemed to have paid off in a visceral way.

        I don't want to predict or promise what I might or could do in the future,

        I love side projects. Working on creative ideas born (usually) during showers
        has brought the spontaneous side out of me and stretched my imagination and abilities.

      <p class="lead">
        (For example, this webpage is a continuous project where I apply the latest web dev skills I learned
        to showcase my past and current experiences

        Whether it's getting insights out of large amounts of information
        or visually presenting them to a general audience, I learnt a lot working on them.

                Using entrance data to UCLA facilities, I helped students choose the right time and place to go work out. This was my proudest project and it involved: writing a proposal to request data, simulating traffic patterns using statistical models, highlighting the "present" in graphics, and writing responsive code on the frontend.

                  In this machine learning contest, the biggest challenge was to estimate a probability distribution for each observation, rather than simply provide a one-shot classification. To deal with this challenge, I tried random sampling and feature engineering. Having done other Kaggle competitions, I learn the most from this.
