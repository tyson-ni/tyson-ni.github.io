## Who am I

I'm an entrepreneur based in San Francisco who has spent 7 years as data scientist in the Bay Area tech scene. I live and breathe data, all kinds of data: sports, politics, markets, personal hobbies, etc. My professional experiences include:

- [Mudflap](https://www.mudflapinc.com/) (2023-2025): I owned credit risk analytics for a business credit product at the Series A startup that is focused on diesel fuel discounts for truckers. My job was to determine, at scale, who we should approve for the card and for how much money.

- [Affirm](https://affirm.com/) (2019-2023): A formative career experience where I started on the Product Analytics team and ended up doing Credit Risk, all while preparing for and going through the IPO. In my first role, I helped PM's ship new products and run A/B tests. Later, I owned the risk analytics for our D2C lending product. I ran experiments and made decisions to optimize the interest fees, credit limits and ML models.  

- [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) (2017-2019): In my first job out of school, I developed NLP models for HR to help the company detect employee sentiment and improve collaboration between individuals. Looking back, my job would have been 10x easier if we had LLMs!
