I'm fascinated by the combination of **two powerful forces: AI and markets**.

**Why AI?** Models embed a vast amount of knowledge and can generalize from relatively few instances. Humans are limited to their own experiences, while AI is already capable of [reasoning](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model) about specific mechanisms of the world from limited inputs.

**Why markets?** Markets have proven to be very efficient at aggregating information in human societies. They are also well suited for a fast moving world where attention spans are short and [entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_stock) is king. We will see more markets, they will be in more places, more fun, available all the time and on-demand. 

**Why both?** They are both incredible at aggregating knowledge, but they are different and complementary. AI should be better at deep analysis and reasoning about particular details, while markets are better at sourcing high-level signals from diverse participants.
