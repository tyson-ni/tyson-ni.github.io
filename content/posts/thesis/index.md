I'm fascinated by the combination of **two powerful forces: AI and markets**.

**Why AI?** Models embed vast amounts of knowledge and can generalize from relatively few instances. Humans are limited to their own experiences, while AI is already capable of [reasoning](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model) about specific mechanisms of the world from limited inputs.

**Why markets?** Markets have proven to be very efficient at aggregating information in human societies. They are also well suited for a fast-paced world where attention spans are short and [entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_stock) is king. We will see more markets, they will be in more places, more fun, and available all the time. 

**Why both?** Both are incredible at aggregating knowledge, but they are different and complementary. AI is better at reasoning and explaining details and mechanisms, while markets are better at sourcing signals from diverse or competitive individuals.

**Social knowledge** Everyone knows certain things deeply and has something unique to offer. We are also a tough nut to crack - we don't even always know ourselves. Getting better at aggregating, explaining and acting on what people know and how they act leads to a better informed world, and in turn, makes each individual feel more valued and each business more successful.

**Areas of opportunity** 

- Prediction markets
- Product development and user research
- Retail trading and investment
- Agentic auditing
